        <h2>TechBoost Ghana: Empowering SMEs through Digital Transformation</h2>
        <p><strong>NGO Name:</strong> Impact Horizon (UK)</p>
        <p><strong>Project Duration:</strong> 2-3 months per session</p>
        <p><strong>Location:</strong> Ga South District, Ghana</p>
        <h3>Background & Objectives</h3>
        <p>This concept note is presented by Impact Horizon, an international non-profit organization with the mission to create sustainable change in communities through education, poverty alleviation, and environmental conservation initiatives. We aim to provide access to education and resources, create economic opportunities, and promote sustainable living practices to help alleviate poverty and create a better future for all. We find and support local early-stage entrepreneurs who work towards one or more of the sustainable development goals set up by the UN. The entrepreneurs are supported to scale their innovations/business through capacity building, networks and funding, all in partnership with multiple sectors.
            As the world battles a pandemic that has claimed over eight hundred and seventy thousand lives and infected millions of people globally, day-to-day life has been turned on its head. The World Bank in its April 8, 2020, edition of the Africa Pulse Report indicates that the continent will tip into a recession with forecasted growth expected to decline from 2.4% in 2019 to - 5.1% in 2020. In Ghana, this is reflected by a predicted decline in growth from 6.8% to below 2% by the end Of 2020, and there is likely to be significant liquidity issues over the crash in world oil prices, whilst big business has not escaped massive disruptions to operations, start-ups micro, small and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) and social enterprises have been among the hardest hit. 
            Impact Horizon is committed to supporting MSMEs especially early-stage enterprises (both formal and informal and the ecosystems they operate in through this crisis, helping them to adapt to an environment that has changed overnight. In addition to emergency response and supporting businesses to adapt to vastly different social behaviours, we will work towards the long term and develop pathways to resilience for MSMEs and local businesses in a world that is forever altered. Each of our deeply rooted local teams has been working round the clock to understand the individual impact of each of the businesses in their portfolios. We are taking this learning at a national and global level and combining it to build our insights into the challenges they face to develop toolkits and customise them.

        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>
            While Ghana is full of entrepreneurial and innovative solutions, there are challenges to the growth of MSMEs and local businesses that are being exacerbated by COVID-19 and the fallout from the pandemic, the Russian war on Ukraine and other global events. Supply chains are being interrupted, distribution is a challenge, businesses are struggling to take advantage of online opportunities and customer bases aren't used to accessing services in the way they are now being forced to. This has created challenges for local businesses including:
            1. Reduced revenues as economic activity slows down due to uncertainty, travel and other restrictions and general economic slowdown.
            2. Reduced revenues due to lack of planning, mismanagement of funds and financial indiscipline of business owners, especially informal businesses.
            3. Reduction in revenues due to a lack of knowledge in entrepreneurial and basic bookkeeping skills leading to eventual collapse of businesses.
            4. Unstructured business operations and inadequate data and systems for decision-making and effective management of their businesses in times of crises.
            5. Inadequate managerial and entrepreneurial skills to pivot their business models in response to the implications and fallouts of the pandemic.
            6. Inadequate digital capabilities to take advantage of the opportunities that are arising and to retain customers through online and other digital channels.
            Businesses need to streamline their portfolio of products and services to focus on the ones that can thrive in the short and long term.

        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <p>
            The TechBoost Ghana initiative by Impact Horizon seeks to leverage technology as a driving force to empower maximum of 20 Intern Facilitators working closely with Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and young entrepreneurs in the Ga South District. The primary goal is to provide comprehensive business support services and catalyze the digital transformation of these businesses. Simultaneously, Intern Facilitators will gain valuable experience in applying technology solutions in a developing country context.
        </p>
        <h3>Key Activities</h3>

        Online Marketing Strategies:
        Train entrepreneurs in effective use of social media platforms for marketing and brand promotion.

        Impact Horizon will facilitate cultural exchange sessions between Intern Facilitators and local entrepreneurs to promote mutual understanding and collaboration.
        Encourage knowledge-sharing and the exchange of innovative ideas between Intern Facilitators and local business owners.
        Alternative Boards with Technology Focus:
        Establish alternative boards for mid-sized SMEs with a specific focus on technology integration.

        As part of the holistic experience, Impact Horizon will organize a tourism trip to Cape Coast and Kumasi for all Intern Facilitators. This trip aims to offer cultural insights, foster team bonding, and provide a deeper understanding of Ghana's history and heritage. Activities may include visits to historical sites, museums, and engaging with the local community. This excursion not only contributes to the Intern Facilitators' overall experience but also supports the local tourism industry.

        To ensure a well-rounded experience, Impact Horizon will organize weekend activities for Intern Facilitators and participants. These activities may include cultural workshops, local community engagement, and recreational outings (including the beaches around the area). The intention is to create a supportive and collaborative community among the Intern Facilitators, local entrepreneurs, and the people of Ga South District.
        Tech-Enhanced Tourism and Weekend Activities:
        Integrate technology in the tourism trip by utilizing augmented reality apps for historical site exploration.
        Include tech-themed weekend activities, such as coding workshops, digital storytelling, and community engagement through online platforms.
        Monitoring and Evaluation:
        Track the digital footprint of SMEs, measuring the impact of technology on online presence, customer engagement, and sales.
        Assess the success of technology-focused initiatives through analytics, feedback sessions, and quantifiable improvements in business operations.
        The TechBoost Ghana project is poised to not only enhance the business capabilities of SMEs and Entrepreneurs in the Ga South District but also equip Intern Facilitators with practical experience in driving digital transformation in a developing country setting. Impact Horizon believes that embracing technology will create a sustainable and interconnected business ecosystem, contributing to long-term growth and prosperity in the region.

        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
        <p>
            To ensure sustainability beyond the project period, Impact Horizon will create an alumni network which will bring together all the entrepreneurs who would have received support under the program. This will be done with a common WhatsApp platform that will allow all to keep in touch with each other. Impact Horizon will steer the conversation on the platform and provide light touch support to any challenges that may be raised by each of the entrepreneurs/SMEs or Intern Facilitators at any given time. Impact Horizon will organise occasional networking sessions to allow for experience sharing and transition the alternative board scheme into its continuous support program as well as possible market linkages. Further business skills development support programs will be extended to the entrepreneurs from time to time as Impact Horizon raises funds towards such programs.
        </p>
